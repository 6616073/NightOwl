# NightOwl

AutoEnable Twitter dark theme based on local sunset and sunrise time

## How It Works

After installing NightOwl and running Twitter application, NightOwl finds sunrise and sunset time in your local area and saves them. For every next time, NightOwl gets current time and checks whether it is day or night; and based on that, chooses to enable dark theme or standard one.

Developed and tested on iOS 9.0.2, Twitter 6.60.
